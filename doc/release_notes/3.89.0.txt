= New Features

* The render plugin now supports an :assume_fixed_locals option,
  which allows for better caching when all templates use fixed
  locals, by using a simplified cache key, and avoiding duplicate
  cache entries for templates rendered both with and without locals.

  Additionally, when this plugin option is set, calling template
  methods is now faster if the following are true:

  * The application is frozen
  * Template caching is enabled
  * Ruby version is 3+

* A part plugin has been added, which simplifies rendering a template
  with locals:

    # render plugin
    render(:template, locals: {foo: 'bar'})

    # part plugin
    part(:template, foo: 'bar')

  In addition to offering a nicer API if you only need to provide
  locals, the part method can also be faster if all of the
  following are true:

  * The application is frozen
  * The :assume_fixed_locals render plugin option is set
  * Template caching is enabled
  * Ruby version is 3+ (even faster on Ruby 3.4+)
  
= Other Improvements

* The mailer plugin's mail and sendmail class methods now support
  keyword arguments and pass them as keywords to the r.mail blocks
  in the routing tree.
