= Improvements

* The send_file method in the sinatra_helpers plugin now returns
  a response body that implements to_path.

* Roda now sets a temporary name for the remaining anonymous
  modules and classes on Ruby 3.3+.

* The common_logger plugin now escapes embedded newlines.  These
  should only be present if the server is broken and including
  newlines in things it shouldn't.
