      <h1>Why <span class="roda">Roda</span>?</h1>

<p>There are already plenty of Ruby web frameworks. Why another one? Well, Roda has a very useful combination of features that make web development easy.  It's designed to be fast, <acronym title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</acronym>, and correct.  It's probably easiest to explain the advantages by comparing it with <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com">Sinatra</a>, which it tries to emulate in many respects.</p>

<h3>Routing Tree</h3>

<p>The primary difference between Roda and Sinatra is that Roda uses a routing tree, while Sinatra uses a list of routes.  At any point in the routing tree, Roda allows you to operate on the current request.  If your URLs reflect your application architecture, this allows you to have DRYer code.  Let's examine code examples for a very simple app, implemented in both Sinatra and Roda:</p>

<div class="col-md-6">
Roda:
<pre><code class="ruby">require 'roda'

class App &lt; Roda
  plugin :render
  plugin :all_verbs

  route do |r|
    r.root do
      view :index
    end

    r.is 'artist/:id' do |artist_id|
      @artist = Artist[artist_id]
      check_access(@artist)

      r.get do
        view :artist
      end

      r.post do
        @artist.update(r['artist'])
        r.redirect
      end

      r.delete do
        @artist.destroy
        r.redirect '/'
      end
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="col-md-6">
Sinatra:
<pre><code class="ruby">require 'sinatra/base'

class App &lt; Sinatra::Base
  get '/' do
    erb :index
  end

  get '/artist/:id' do
    @artist = Artist[params[:id]]
    check_access(@artist)
    erb :artist
  end

  post '/artist/:id' do
    @artist = Artist[params[:id]]
    check_access(@artist)
    @artist.update(params[:artist])
    redirect(request.path_info)
  end

  delete '/artist/:id' do
    @artist = Artist[params[:id]]
    check_access(@artist)
    @artist.destory
    redirect '/' 
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p style="clear: both;">While the Roda code is slightly longer, it should be apparent that it is actually simpler.  Instead of setting the <span class="code">@artist</span> variable and checking that access is allowed in all three of the sinatra routes, the variables are set as soon as that branch of the tree is taken, and can be used in all routes under that branch.  This is why Roda is called a routing tree web framework.  This is a very simplified example, but if you see this type of duplication in a lot of the Sinatra code you write, your app could probably be made simpler by converting to Roda.</p>

<h3>Faster</h3>

<p>In addition to being more maintainable, Roda's approach is also faster in general.   Sinatra routes requests by testing each of the stored routes against the current request, in order.  With Roda, once one branch of the tree matches, only routes inside that branch are considered, not any routes after that branch.  Roda also has support for a single route that dispatches to multiple branches via the multi_route and multi_run plugins.  For large applications, routing in Sinatra is roughly O(n), where n is the number of routes, while routing in Roda can be close to O(log n), depending on how you structure your routing tree.  For small applications, because Roda is simpler internally, <a href="https://github.com/luislavena/bench-micro#requestssec">Roda is about 2.5 times faster than Sinatra</a>.</p>

<h3>Plugin System</h3>

<p>Another difference between Roda and Sinatra is that Roda has a very small core, with a plugin system modeled on <a href="http://sequel.jeremyevans.net">Sequel</a>'s.  All parts of Roda (class/instance/request/response) can be overridden by plugins and call super to get the default behavior.  This includes when plugins are applied to the Roda class itself (affecting all subclasses).  The reason Roda is referred to as a toolkit is that by using different combinations of plugins, you can build the routing tree web framework that meets your needs.<p>

<p>Many features that are built into Sinatra are shipped as plugins in Roda. This way they can easily be used if needed, but if you don't use them you don't pay the cost for loading them.  Near the top of the Roda example, you can see <span class="code">plugin :render</span>, which adds support for template rendering, and <span class="code">plugin :all_verbs</span>, which adds routing methods for all HTTP request methods.

<h3>Less Pollution</h3>

<p>Finally, Roda is very concerned about pollution.  In this case, pollution of the scope in which the route block operates.  Roda purposely limits the instance variables, instance methods, and class namespaces available in the route block scope, so that it is very unlikely you will run into conflicts.  If you've ever tried to use an instance variable named <span class="code">@request</span> inside a <span class="code">Sinatra::Base</span> subclass, you'll appreciate that Roda attempts to avoid polluting the scope.</p>

<h3>Immutable</h3>

<p>In production use, Roda applications are designed to be frozen (using the standard <span class="code">freeze</span> method), which freezes all internal datastructures (except thead-safe caches used at runtime).  This makes it almost impossible to have thread-safety issues when using Roda.</p>
