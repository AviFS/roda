Issue Guidelines
----------------

1) Issues should only be created for things that are definitely bugs.
   If you are not sure that the behavior is a bug, ask about it on
   IRC or the ruby-roda Google Group.  GitHub Issues should not be
   used as a help forum.

2) If you are sure it is a bug, then post a complete description of
   the issue, the simplest possible self-contained example showing
   the problem, and the full backtrace of any exception.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

1) Try to include tests for all new features and substantial bug
   fixes.

2) Try to include documentation for all new features.  In most cases
   this should include RDoc method documentation, but updates to the
   README is also appropriate in some cases.

3) Follow the style conventions of the surrounding code.  In most
   cases, this is standard ruby style.

4) Do not submit whitespace changes with code changes.  Roda is not
   pedantic about trailing whitespace, so if you have an editor that
   automatically strips trailing whitespace, you may want to turn
   that feature off.
   
5) All code in pull requests is assummed to be MIT licensed.  Do not
   submit a pull request if that isn't the case.

Code of Conduct
---------------

This code of conduct applies to all of the project's "collaborative
space", which is defined as community communications channels,
including the Google Group, GitHub project, source code repository,
and IRC channel.

1) Participants must ensure that their language and actions are free
   of personal attacks and remarks disparaging to people or groups.

2) Behaviour which can be reasonably considered harassment will not
   be tolerated.

3) Discussion should be limited to the project and related
   technologies.

You can report a violation of this code of conduct to the project
maintainer, who will take appropriate action.
